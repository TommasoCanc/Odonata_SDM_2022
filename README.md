## Abstract
Climate change is rearranging the mosaic of biodiversity worldwide. These broad-scale species re-distributions affect the structure and composition of communities with a ripple effect on multiple biodiversity facets. Using European Odonata, we asked: i) how climate change will redefine taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional diversity at continental scales; ii) which traits will mediate species' response to global change; and iii) whether this response will be conserved across the phylogeny. Using stacked species distribution models, we observed broad latitudinal and altitudinal rearrangements in Odonata community composition determining broad turnovers in traits and evolutionary lineages. According to our phylogenetic regression models, only body size and flight period can be partly correlated with observed range shifts. In considering all primary facets of biodiversity, our results support the design of inclusive conservation strategies able to account the diversity of species, the ecosystem services they provide, and the phylogenetic heritage they carry in a target ecosystem.
